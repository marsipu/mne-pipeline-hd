# mne_pipeline_hd
### A [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) Pipeline for MEG-Lab Heidelberg
###### based on: [Andersen, L.M., 2018. Group Analysis in MNE-Python of Evoked Responses from a Tactile Stimulation Paradigm: A Pipeline for Reproducibility at Every Step of Processing, Going from Individual Sensor Space Representations to an across-Group Source Space Representation. Front. Neurosci. 12.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.00006)

## Installation
1. Install MNE-python as instructed on the [website](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/install_mne_python.html),
I would recommend to install in a separate conda environment with:
`conda env create -n mne_p -f environment.yml`
2. `conda activate mne_p`
3. `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/marsipu/mne_pipeline_hd/zipball/master`

(or do `pip install -e --upgrade https://github.com/marsipu/mne_pipeline_hd/zipball/master`
 when you are in a directory where you want the mne_pipeline_hd-scripts installed)


## Update
Just run `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/marsipu/mne_pipeline_hd/zipball/master` again

## Start
Run `python mne_pipeline_hd` in your mne_pipeline-environment (`conda activate mne_p`)

**or**

Load the Pipeline-folder in an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, Atom, etc. and run \_\_main\_\_.py\

***When using the pipeline and its functions bear in mind that the pipeline is stil in development 
and the functions are partly still adjusted to my analysis!***

## Bug-Report/Feature-Request
Please report bugs on GitHub as an issue or to me (mne.pipeline@gmail.com) directly.
And if you got ideas on how to improve the pipeline or some feature-requests,
you are welcome to open an issue too or send an e-mail (mne.pipeline@gmail.com)

## Contribute and build your own functions/fix bugs

If you want to help me with the development and/or customize the pipeline to fit your needs, do it like this:
